* Designed for wide screens.
* Static tiling; you get just three fixed asymmetric tiles and windows never move automatically.
* Bare minimum EWMH to support panels and (simpleswitcher)[https://github.com/seanpringle/simpleswitcher]
* A few keyboard controls for moving, focusing, cycling, closing.
* config.h for customization of borders and keys.
